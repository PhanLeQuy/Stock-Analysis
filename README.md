Stock Analysis Description
I. DESCRIPTION:
    This project was created and developed during my first journey of self-studying Power BI and this is also my FIRST PROJECT. In this project I used historical data of stock tickers of companies on both NASDAQ and NYSE exchanges and this dataset of stock tickers was recorded from 1970 - 2022. From there I decided to turn this raw dataset into a simple simulation of a regular stock trading dashboard.
    In the report, I have reproduced the basic information and indicators available on the stock market platform of the stock code such as closing price, highest/lowest price of the day, highest/lowest price in 52 weeks, total trading volume and percentage change compared to the previous day. Accompanying that is the core industry in which the stock code does business.
    For each exchange, I have designed basic but extremely important common charts that any exchange has:
- Price and volume chart.
- SMA (Simple Moving Average) chart.
- Candlestick chart.
    This project illustrates how I approached my experience learning Power BI (a powerful data analytics and visualization tool) where I was able to integrate real-world financial metrics with an actionable scenario relevant to the industry.

The dataset provided in the Stock Market dataset includes daily trading information ranging from 1970 to 2022, with data sourced from NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1,564 (NASDAQ) and 1,145 listed companies (NYSE), respectively. It includes key fields such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, Volume, Stock Codes and Sector.
